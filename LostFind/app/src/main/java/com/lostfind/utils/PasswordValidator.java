/*
Password Regular Expression Pattern
((?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[@#$%]).{6,20})
Description

(			# Start of group
  (?=.*\d)		#   must contains one digit from 0-9
  (?=.*[a-z])		#   must contains one lowercase characters
  (?=.*[A-Z])		#   must contains one uppercase characters
  (?=.*[@#$%])		#   must contains one special symbols in the list "@#$%"
              .		#     match anything with previous condition checking
                {6,20}	#        length at least 6 characters and maximum of 20
)			# End of group
?= – means apply the assertion condition, meaningless by itself, always work with other combination

Whole combination is means, 6 to 20 characters string with at least one digit,
one upper case letter, one lower case letter and one special symbol (“@#$%”). This regular expression pattern is very useful to implement a strong and complex password.
